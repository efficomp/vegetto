Welcome to Vegetto's documentation!
===================================

Vegetto i a `DEAP <https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_-based evolutionary procedure
designed to solve multi-objective optimization feature selection problems.

Specifically, a wrapper has been designed where NSGA-II is used as search strategy,
while *k*-NN is used as classification algorithm for the evaluation of potential solutions.

This wrapper is designed with two premises in mind: to reach solutions as close as
possible to the global optimum and to perform the computation in an efficient way. For
the latter, four efficient versions of *k*-NN have been developed in C++, where the
data conversion between both languages is carried out with the `Pybind11 <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ library. If maximum
efficiency is desired, the last version of *k*-NN should be chosen, since this is a mechanism
that chooses the most optimal version depending on the number of selected features.
